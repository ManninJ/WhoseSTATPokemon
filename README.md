WhoseSTATPokemon is a broswer game that is heavily inspired by the popular browser game: The Higher Lower Game.

2 Pokemon will appear on screen, fetched from PokeAPI: https://pokeapi.co/ along with a random Pokemon stat (HP, Attack, Defence, Special Attack, Special Defence, or Speed) and the player will have to select the Pokemon that they believe has the higher of that stat.
If the play is correct, 2 new Pokemon will be fetched and another random stat will be selected.

The goal is to get the highest score before being incorrect.

Eventually the game will have a leaderboard feature where players will be able to save their high scores to, in order to compare with other players.

There will also be a settings tab inplemented which will allow players to choose what generations of Pokemon they wish to be chosen.
e.g. A Player may only want to play with Gen 1 pokemon.

The game will feature a timer that will count down from 10, if the player does not choose a Pokemon in that time, they will lose. This will be to prevent cheating via looking up the Pokemon's stats.
